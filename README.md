### Chrome extensions
- duplicate tab (I'm duplicating tabs all the time, e.g., Amazon - looking at a product, want to keep the tab open but click on other links in the page; LinkedIn - looking at a profile, keep it open, but click on links; Google Sheets -- want to open other tabs)
- Extensity

### Chrome features
- tab groups
- shift+cmd+A (Tab > Search Tabs)
