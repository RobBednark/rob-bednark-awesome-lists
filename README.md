# Chrome

## Chrome extensions
- **duplicate tab** - quickly duplicate the current tab with a keyboard shortcut (I'm duplicating tabs all the time, e.g., Amazon - looking at a product, want to keep the tab open but click on other links in the page; LinkedIn - looking at a profile, keep it open, but click on links; Google Sheets -- want to open other tabs)
- **Extensity** - enabling/disabling other extensions on the fly
- **Obsidian Web** - highlight and save web page content to Obsidian
- **GoFullPage** - scroll-and-save the entire current web page as a single png image, or as a pdf
